# the_bib
This is the main.bib used in my papers. The topics are primarily of planing hulls and the multi-objective optimization of craft geometry and active control systems. This .bib is not meant to represent an up-to-date collection of works on any topic, and is currently only modified during the write-up of a paper.

## Usage
This .bib file is managed with [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/).

Use in a LaTeX document with BibTeX:

```latex
\begin{document}

\section{Test}
One should consider the propeller forces when optimizing a high-performance planing craft \cite{Hadler1966}.

\bibliography{main} %This creates the references section.

\end{document}
```
